This repository contains the backend implementation for the Blog Site Application.
It is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and follows a microservices-based architecture with JWT authentication.

📌 Overview

The backend is responsible for:

User registration and authentication

Blog creation, deletion, and retrieval

Public blog discovery with filters

Secure access using JWT

Separation of concerns using multiple services

🏗️ Architecture
Client (React UI)
      |
      v
API Gateway (Port 4000)

      ├── User Service (Auth & Identity)
      └── Blog Service (Blog Domain)

Key Concepts Used

Microservices Architecture

RESTful APIs

JWT-based Authentication (Stateless)

Express Middleware

Repository Pattern

CQRS (Command / Query separation in blog service)

📦 Services
1️⃣ User Service

Responsible for user identity and authentication.

Features

User Registration

User Login (JWT Token Generation)

Database

MongoDB (Users collection)

2️⃣ Blog Service

Responsible for blog management and discovery.

Features

Create Blog (Authenticated)

Delete Blog (Authenticated & Ownership-based)

Get blogs created by authenticated user

Get all public blogs

Filter blogs by category and date range

Database

MongoDB (Blogs collection)

🔐 Authentication & Security

Authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

JWT is generated by User Service and validated by Blog Service

Same JWT_SECRET is shared across services via environment variables

Protected routes require:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

Token Handling

Stateless authentication

Token expiry handled via JWT exp

Expired tokens return 401 Unauthorized
